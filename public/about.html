<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
	My name is Sharon and I have periodically learned to code in various
	languages over the years for various projects, and now attempting to fit the
	pieces together to be a web developer!
</p>

<p>
	I have dabbled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, C#, and currently taking
	courses to refresh my memory on each of them as well as expand my knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	One side project that I am currently working on is a mobile word search app
	with a twist, using Unity and C#.
